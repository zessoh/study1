Inspired by personal experiences, Linklater collaborated with Krizan to develop the screenplay, who previously appeared in his films Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993). Casting was extensive; it took nine months for Hawke and Delpy to be cast, with the pair also contributing uncredited rewrites. Principal photography took place entirely in Vienna.
